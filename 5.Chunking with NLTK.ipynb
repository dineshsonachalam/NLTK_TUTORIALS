    "### What is chunking?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Text chunking, also referred to as shallow parsing, is a task that follows Part-Of-Speech Tagging and that adds more structure to the sentence. The result is a grouping of the words in “chunks”. Here’s a quick example:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "            (S\n",
    "            (NP Every/DT day/NN)\n",
    "            ,/,\n",
    "            (NP I/PRP)\n",
    "            (VP buy/VBP)\n",
    "            (NP something/NN)\n",
    "            (PP from/IN)\n",
    "            (NP the/DT corner/NN shop/NN))\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In other words, in a shallow parse tree, there’s one maximum level between the root and the leaves. A deep parse tree looks like this:\n",

    "- Chunking is a very similar task to Named-Entity-Recognition. In fact, the same format, IOB-tagging is used.\n",

    "- chunking is to group into what are known as \"noun phrases.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "- These are phrases of one or more words that contain a noun, maybe some descriptive words, maybe a verb, and maybe something like an adverb.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Idea is to group nouns with the words that are in relation to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "-  In order to chunk, we combine the part of speech tags with regular expressions. Mainly from regular expressions, we are going to utilize the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "            + = match 1 or more\n",
    "            ? = match 0 or 1 repetitions.\n",
    "            * = match 0 or MORE repetitions\t  \n",
